# Rock Paper Scissor -JavaScript Project

## Overview

This project recreates the classic game Rock · Paper · Scissors (also known as Roshambo) using JavaScript.
It was completed without AI assistance or reference to existing solutions, as part of my learning through The Odin Project.

The game runs entirely in the console, focusing on logic, functions, control flow, and user interaction through prompt().

## Features

Console-based gameplay

Human input with case-insensitive validation

Randomized computer choice

Five-round match with score tracking

Final winner announcement

Use pseudocode to outline the problem-solving approach

## Technologies Used

HTML5 (minimal scaffolding)

JavaScript (ES6+)

VS Code

Git & GitHub

Command Line (CLI)

## Lessons Learned

Keeping pseudocode at the top made the entire project easier to navigate and debug.

Breaking problems into small, testable functions using console.log leads to clearer logic.

Realizing that frustration is part of the learning process — but having a structured plan reduces it.

The importance of using documentation (especially MDN Web Docs) as a reference instead of memorizing syntax.

Understanding when certain tools (like ternary operators, that I used when first deciding the winner) are appropriate — and when a full conditional is clearer.

## Next Steps / Possible Enhancements

(Not required, but adding this makes your repo look thoughtful and future-oriented.)

Add a simple browser UI with buttons

Display results inside the webpage instead of the console

Allow the user to play until they choose to quit

Add animations or icons for the choices
